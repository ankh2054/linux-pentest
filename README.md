Linux pentest tools



### linuxprivchecker.py 

This script is intended to be executed locally on a Linux box to enumerate basic system info and 
search for common privilege escalation vectors such as world writable files, misconfigurations, clear-text
passwords and applicable exploits.


### portknock.sh

Port knock script using nmap. Requests multiple ports as variables.
Knocks on all three ports in all possible combinations.

### linuxenum.sh

Script to enumerate local information from a Linux host

### shellshock.sh

Easily test the system for the presence of CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187 - also known as Shellshock. The script iterates all the $PATH directories, looking for bash and sh. Some systems, like OS X, also use bash for sh.

If the word VULNERABLE is in the output, then the shell isn't patched. I am doing Captain Obvious here. Yes, it's THAT serious.
